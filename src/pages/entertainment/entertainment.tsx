            For those who know me it won't be a suprise that all of the top 5
            picks are production of studio Ghibli.
            <br />
            You might have to take my word on this one but the works of studio
            Ghibli especially the ones that are mentioned here is something
            else. From production to story to everything, it's just perfect...
            <br />
