            Welcome to the learning section of my website...
            <br /> <br />
            This is where I shall share the resources and stuff that you as well
            can use to learn new things...
            <br />
            Most of these things will be realated to computer science and might
            be very boring to many of you. But if you keep perusing you might
            find something of interest...
            <br />
            This may include some really useaful git repositories, video links,
            books, articles and more...
            <br /> <br /> HAPPY LEARNING!!! üòÅ
