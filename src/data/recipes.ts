    Although simple there are few things that I personally do to make sure that my drink is good.
     One is to not squeze the lemons with the help of tools 
     (this makes sure that we dont get that bitter part of lemon), another thing that I do is 
    addition of black salt or rock salt. You can occasionally use any ammount of sparkling water as extra touch`,
